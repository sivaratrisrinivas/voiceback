## Implementation Prompts

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### Step 1: Project Structure & Environment

```
Create a Python project structure for "Voiceback" voice agent using Vapi. Set up:

1. Directory structure:
   - src/ (main application code)
   - config/ (configuration files)
   - tests/ (test files)
   - docs/ (documentation)

2. Create requirements.txt with essential dependencies:
   - vapi-python (or requests for Vapi API)
   - python-dotenv
   - pytest
   - logging libraries

3. Create .env template with:
   - VAPI_API_KEY
   - PHONE_NUMBER
   - LOG_LEVEL
   - ENVIRONMENT

4. Create src/main.py as entry point with basic imports and structure

5. Write a simple test in tests/test_main.py to verify the setup works

Ensure the project can be pip installed and basic tests pass. This is the foundation - keep it minimal but functional.
```

#### Step 2: Basic Vapi Connection & Health Check

```
Building on the previous project structure, implement basic Vapi connectivity:

1. In src/vapi_client.py, create a VapiClient class that:
   - Initializes with API key from environment
   - Has a health_check() method to verify API connectivity
   - Handles basic connection errors gracefully

2. In src/main.py, integrate the VapiClient and add:
   - Environment loading
   - Basic logging setup
   - Health check on startup

3. Write tests in tests/test_vapi_client.py that:
   - Mock the Vapi API calls
   - Test successful connection
   - Test connection failure handling

4. Create a simple CLI command to test connectivity: python src/main.py --health-check

The goal is to have a working connection to Vapi with proper error handling and testing. No call handling yet - just connectivity verification.
```

#### Step 3: Basic Call Handling Infrastructure

```
Extend the existing Vapi integration to handle incoming calls:

1. In src/call_handler.py, create a CallHandler class that:
   - Receives incoming call webhooks from Vapi
   - Has methods for answer_call() and end_call()
   - Logs call events (start, end)

2. Update src/vapi_client.py to include:
   - Method to register webhook endpoints
   - Basic call control (answer, hangup)

3. In src/main.py, add:
   - Webhook server setup (using Flask or FastAPI)
   - Route for handling Vapi webhooks
   - Integration with CallHandler

4. Add tests in tests/test_call_handler.py that:
   - Mock webhook calls
   - Verify call lifecycle management
   - Test logging functionality

The system should now answer calls and immediately hang up, with proper logging. This establishes the basic call flow without any voice interaction yet.
```

#### Step 4: Basic Greeting Delivery

```
Add voice response capability to deliver a simple greeting:

1. Extend src/call_handler.py to include:
   - send_voice_message() method
   - Basic greeting text: "Welcome to Voiceback. Thank you for calling. Goodbye."
   - Proper call flow: answer → greeting → hangup

2. Update src/vapi_client.py with:
   - Text-to-speech integration via Vapi
   - Voice configuration (neutral, warm tone)
   - Message delivery methods

3. Enhance src/main.py webhook handling to:
   - Trigger greeting on call connect
   - Handle voice delivery completion
   - Manage call termination after greeting

4. Add tests in tests/test_voice_delivery.py:
   - Mock voice synthesis calls
   - Verify greeting text and timing
   - Test call flow completion

The system now answers calls, says a greeting, and hangs up. This proves the voice delivery pipeline works before adding complexity.
```

### Phase 2: Configuration System

#### Step 5: Configuration File Structure

```
Create the emotion-to-quote configuration system:

1. In config/responses.json, create initial structure with 2-3 emotions:
   - Each emotion has: figure, context_lines, quote, encouragement_lines
   - Include at least: anxiety (Seneca), sadness (Marcus Aurelius)
   - Use the exact JSON structure from the specification

2. Create src/config_manager.py with:
   - ConfigManager class to load and validate responses.json
   - Methods: load_config(), get_emotions(), get_response(emotion)
   - Basic validation that required fields exist

3. Add config/ directory to .gitignore for sensitive data, but include responses.json as template

4. Write tests in tests/test_config_manager.py:
   - Test successful config loading
   - Test validation errors for malformed config
   - Test emotion retrieval

Focus only on loading and accessing the configuration. No emotion detection or response logic yet - just reliable config management.
```

#### Step 6: Configuration Loading & Validation

```
Enhance the configuration system with robust validation and error handling:

1. Extend src/config_manager.py with:
   - Schema validation for responses.json structure
   - Required field checking (figure, quote, context_lines, encouragement_lines)
   - Validation that arrays have at least one item
   - Clear error messages for configuration problems

2. Add configuration caching and reload capability:
   - Cache loaded config in memory
   - Method to reload config without restart
   - Validation on every load

3. Create src/models.py with data classes:
   - EmotionResponse class
   - HistoricalFigure class  
   - Clear type hints throughout

4. Expand tests in tests/test_config_manager.py:
   - Test various invalid configurations
   - Test configuration caching
   - Test data model validation

5. Integrate with src/main.py:
   - Load configuration on startup
   - Graceful failure if config is invalid
   - Health check includes config validation

The system now has bulletproof configuration management. The greeting still works, but we're ready to add emotion-based responses.
```

#### Step 7: Basic Emotion-to-Quote Mapping

```
Implement simple emotion-to-quote lookup without detection logic:

1. Extend src/config_manager.py with:
   - get_random_response(emotion) method
   - Randomization of context_lines and encouragement_lines
   - Fallback handling for unknown emotions (default to Seneca)

2. Create src/response_builder.py with:
   - ResponseBuilder class
   - format_response(emotion, user_input) method
   - Template: "It sounds like you're feeling [emotion]. [context] [quote] [encouragement]"

3. Update the call flow in src/call_handler.py:
   - Change greeting to ask for emotion: "How are you feeling?"
   - Add placeholder for receiving user input (hardcode "anxious" for now)
   - Use ResponseBuilder to create response
   - Deliver formatted response instead of simple greeting

4. Add comprehensive tests:
   - tests/test_response_builder.py for response formatting
   - Test randomization of context/encouragement lines
   - Test fallback behavior

The system now delivers personalized historical quotes, though the emotion is hardcoded. The foundation for dynamic emotion detection is ready.

3. Create comprehensive tests in tests/test_text_processor.py:
   - Test normalization with various inputs
   - Test keyword extraction
   - Test handling of speech artifacts and negations

4. Update src/call_handler.py to use TextProcessor:
   - Process any user input through normalization
   - Log both original and processed text
   - Still hardcode emotion for now, but show processed text in logs

This establishes the text processing pipeline without changing the call flow. The foundation for accurate emotion detection is now ready.

   - Track attempted clarifications (max 1 retry)
   - Default to Seneca/anxiety for completely unclear input

3. Update emotion keywords with confidence weights:
   - High confidence words: "devastated" (1.0), "ecstatic" (1.0)
   - Medium confidence: "sad" (0.7), "happy" (0.7)  
   - Low confidence: "okay" (0.3), "fine" (0.3)
